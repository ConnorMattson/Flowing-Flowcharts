# Flowing Flowcharts

For various courses I've been asked to make flowcharts explaining the logic of my program. Doing this is always a pain and the only interfaces I've found are incredibly slow and often drag and drop based. Because of this I generally resort to drawing the flowchart by hand.

Flowing Flowcharts will allow the user to quickly and easily create simple flowcharts. Need a new element? just press an arrow key to create it! Want to add text to the current element? Just start typing! Flowing flowcharts will be fully keyboard based and won't require the user to explore verbose options menus for each element.
